Hand Actuation System
---------------------

Overview:
  The Hand Actuation System is a cost effective robotic hand designed for dexterous movement and strength manipulation. This system integrates mechanical design, embedded electronics, and a custom control program.

Features:
- 3D printed structure
- Servo actuated joints
- Wrist manipualtion via NEMA 17 stepper motor
- Arduino Uno microcontroller (AVR based)
- Custom control program

Project Roadmap:
- Design and test palm designs (PLA)
- Implement servo control (MG90S servos)
- Design and test finger joints (PLA, aluminum)
- Test finger actuation
- Implement stepper motor control (NEMA 17)
- Design and test wrist joint actuation
- Design and test forearm designs (PLA)
- Test different 3D printing materials
- Redesign and retest

Repo Usage:
- To be annouced
